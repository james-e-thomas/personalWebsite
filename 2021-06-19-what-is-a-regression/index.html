<p>In my line of work - and economics more generally - regression models are common. But without training in economics or statistics, understanding the regression outputs of say, a competition authority, can be complicated. This short note tries to break things down as simply as possible:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>what a regression is; and</li>
<li>how regressions should be interpreted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, there is another valid approach which is ignoring this post, overlooking anything that looks like it contains confusing numbers and hoping that the authority has done a good job with the explanatory text!</p>

<h2>What is a regression?</h2>
<p>A regression model is a statistical model that estimates the relationship between an ‘outcome’ variable (e.g. price) and ‘predictor’ variable(s) (e.g. cost or the presence of a cartel). It seeks to assess the impact of a change in cost or the presence of a cartel on the price of a good.</p>
