      <description>The easiest way of hosting your Shiny App is on shinyapps.io. It’s simple and easy- all you need to do is set up an account and run a few lines from the R console. The downside is that it can be a bit pricey if it’s not just for personal use. In my case there is also the fact that if I want to embed my Shiny App within a static website (which admittedly is a bit of a hack, but it is difficult for me to build the full website using `shiny’ for various reasons), the Shiny App would sdf</description>

      <description>Stata help files are great, but they could sometimes do with a bit more colour!

      <title>Regular expressions in Stata cheat sheet</title>

      <description>The cheat sheet below is based off this great cheat sheet for regular expressions in R by Ian Kopacka.
This is not supposed to be used as an introduction to regular expressions (have a look at the relevant help files and some of the materials shared below for this).
This is also not a complete set of anchors, characters etc for matching, but those shown should be sufficient for most tasks (certainly for what I do at least!</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: the figure will not look good on mobiles/small screens.
The Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) carries out market studies and investigations to make sure that particular markets are operating well.
Using data from the CMA’s website, I have compiled the figure below. It shows all the ‘markets’ cases listed on the website (aside from one which did not appear to have an obvious start date).</description>

The Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) will often publish documents at various points during its cases. I was prompted to write this short piece of code to automate the downloading of these documents when the CMA published 80+ responses from stakeholders to a particular set of working papers.</description>

      <title>Calculating drive times in Stata using the osrmtime command</title>

      <description>This post walks through the (somewhat fiddly) installation and usage of the osrmtime command. It is a Stata command for calculating distances and travel times between two sets of GPS coordinates on a map.
This is done using:
OpenStreetMaps for your map (which you are required to download before running the command such that everything works totally offline)the Open Source Routing Machine (“OSRM”) to determine the shortest distance between A and BIf you have the time to spare, I would read the osrmtime author guide (it’s only 7 pages), but if not, this post is self-contained.</description>
