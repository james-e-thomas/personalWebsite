The Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) will often publish documents at various points during its cases. I was prompted to write this short piece of code to automate the downloading of these documents when the CMA published 80+ responses from stakeholders to a particular set of working papers.</description>

      <description>This post walks through the (somewhat fiddly) installation and usage of the osrmtime command. It is a Stata command for calculating distances and travel times between two sets of GPS coordinates on a map.
This is done using:
OpenStreetMaps for your map (which you are required to download before running the command such that everything works totally offline)the Open Source Routing Machine (“OSRM”) to determine the shortest distance between A and BIf you have the time to spare, I would read the osrmtime author guide (it’s only 7 pages), but if not, this post is self-contained.</description>
