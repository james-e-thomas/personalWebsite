<h5 id="oct-2019-present-1-year-7-months">Oct 2019-Present, <em>(1 year, 7 months)</em></h5>
<p>I am currently working in NERA&rsquo;s Antitrust and Competition Practice in London. 
My experience includes working on a variety of <strong>market investigation</strong>, <strong>merger</strong>, 
<strong>cartel</strong>, <strong>abuse of dominance</strong> and <strong>state aid</strong> cases across a range of industries and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>During my first year at NERA, I spent a lot of time working on a market investigation before the Competition and Markets Authority (&ldquo;CMA&rdquo;). This involved assisting the client in responding to Requests for Information, Working Papers and the Provisional Decision Report.</p>
<p>In particular, I worked with other members of the Competition team on responding to the CMA&rsquo;s <strong>economic profitability analysis</strong> of the client. This involved ensuring that a) certain intangible assets were appropriately valued in the context of an economic profitability analysis and b) the accounting value of tangible assets were uplifted appropriately in cases where these did not adequately represent the &ldquo;replacement cost&rdquo; or &ldquo;Modern Equivalent Asset Value&rdquo; of the assets.</p>
<p>I also worked on responding to the CMA&rsquo;s <strong>entry analysis</strong>, its econometric assessment of the impact of entry on incumbent volumes and prices.</p>
<p>More recently, most of my time has been spent working on an abuse of dominance case before the Turkish Competition Authority, the Rekabet Kurumu. Along with other members of the Competition team, we have helped the client to respond to various Requests for Information. I have also been in charge of processing and analysing the underlying cost, pricing and revenue data in order to help the client assess internally whether there has been any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Whilst these projects have represented the most significant part of my work at NERA, I have had experience working on a variety of other merger, cartel and state aid cases.</p>

<h5 id="jun-aug-2018-3-months">Jun-Aug 2018, <em>(3 months)</em></h5>
<p>I worked in the Prices Platform Development and Support team of the Economic Statistics Change and Support division. I helped to prepare historical CPI and
RPI data to be inputted into the new data storage system for the Prices division.</p>
<p>I also produced a report with two others on the variation in response/drop-off 
rates by demographic for the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey pilot and presented the findings to senior management. This involved data work with large datasets in SPSS.</p>

<h5 id="2018-2019">2018-2019</h5>
<p>Alongside the core Economics modules, I took a number of optional topics in Microeconomics and Competition Economics. See grades attained in table below.</p>
<p>I also wrote a 10,000-word dissertation entitled <em>Analysing Risky Decisions from 
the TV Game Show &ldquo;Deal or No Deal&rdquo;</em>. This examined the predictions of the standard (expected utility) and &lsquo;behavioural&rsquo; (prospect theory) economic models of a 2008 American Economic Review paper by Thierry Post, Martijn J. van den Assem, Guido Baltussen and 2017 Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler. It finds that both models underestimate contestants' propensity to opt for the safe option of <em>Deal</em>-ing (i.e. accepting a much lower, guaranteed payout rather than a higher - but risky - expected payout) when faced with only one &lsquo;large&rsquo; prize remaining on the board. I suggested that this may be related to the suggestion of Friedman et al. (2014) that standard economic models perform poorly because they fail to capture the layman&rsquo;s perception of risk as the threat of harm. A much simpler (logit) regression model (which makes Deal/No Deal predictions simply based on the two largest prizes remaining) is presented, with mixed results.</p>

<h5 id="2015-2018">2015-2018</h5>
<p>I took a variety of core and optional modules covering topics in History, 
Economics and Economic History. In the latter years, I leaned towards Economics, with five out of my eight Final Degree examinations being in Economics.</p>
<p>I also completed a compulsory History dissertation, attaining a grade of 75. The 
dissertation was nominated as the University of Oxford&rsquo;s entry for the <em>History 
of Parliament Undergraduate Thesis Prize</em> - for the best undergraduate 
dissertation relating to British and Irish parliamentary or political history pre-1997.</p>

<h3 id="software-excel-stata-r-python">Software: Excel, Stata, R, Python</h3>
<p>I am proficient in <strong>Excel</strong>, <strong>Stata</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. Though Excel is good for simple modelling and presentation of data and Stata is good for data analyses on a single dataset, I am always interested in developing my capabilities in R and other more powerful programming languages. In exploring the capabilities of other programming languages, I have for example come across the R <code>blogdown</code> package, which I have used to create this website (without any need for knowledge of HTML - the standard language used for constructing web pages).</p>
<p>My capabilities in <strong>Python</strong> at the moment are not as developed as in the other programmes, though I hope to devote time to developing this skill further.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>When not injured (which is unfortunately a lot of the time!), I enjoy <strong>running</strong> around London. I also follow <strong>football</strong> and spend far too much of my free time agonising over my <strong>fantasy football</strong> selections. You can see my team and track record <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/135113/event/28">here</a> and <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/135113/history">here</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time I have developed a web app using the R <code>shiny</code> package which graphs users' performance in their private leagues. When users input their unique fantasy premier league (&ldquo;fpl&rdquo;) id, the programme: 1) retrieves the league ids associated with that unique player id, 2) retrieves the user ids of all participants in those leagues, 3) retrieves gameweek data for all those player ids, 4) processes all the data, and 5) produces a variety of graphs for each of the original user&rsquo;s leagues. The web app (optimised more for mobile rather than desktop usage) can be found at <a href="https://www.fplgraphed.com/">fplgraphed.com</a>.</p>
