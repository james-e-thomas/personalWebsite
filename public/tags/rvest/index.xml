      <description>This post is slightly specific to my work. The Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) will often publish documents at various points during its cases. I was prompted to write this short piece of code to automate the downloading of these documents when the CMA published 80+ responses from stakeholders to a particular set of working papers.
The code uses the rvest package to scrape the CMA’s website and the utils package to download the files.</description>
