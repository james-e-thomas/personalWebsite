      <description>This post is slightly specific to my work. The Competition and Markets Authority (&amp;ldquo;CMA&amp;rdquo;) will often publish documents at various points during its cases. I was prompted to write this short piece of code to automate the downloading of these documents when the CMA published 80+ responses from stakeholders to a particular set of working papers.
The code uses the rvest package to scrape the CMA&amp;rsquo;s website and the utils package to download the files.</description>

      <description>This post walks through the (somewhat fiddly) installation and usage of the osrmtime command. It is a Stata command for calculating distances and travel times between two sets of GPS coordinates on a map.
This is done using:
 OpenStreetMaps for your map (which you are required to download before running the command such that everything works totally offline) the Open Source Routing Machine (&amp;ldquo;OSRM&amp;rdquo;) to determine the shortest distance between A and B  If you have the time to spare, I would read the osrmtime author guide (it&amp;rsquo;s only 7 pages), but if not, this post is self-contained.</description>
