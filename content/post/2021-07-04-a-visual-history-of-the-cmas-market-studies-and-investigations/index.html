<p><em>Disclaimer: the figure will not look good on mobiles/small screens.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority">Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”)</a> carries out <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/competition/markets">market studies and investigations</a></strong> to make sure that particular markets are operating well.</p>
<p>Using data from the CMA’s website, I have compiled the figure below. It shows all the ‘markets’ cases listed on the website (aside from one which did not appear to have an obvious start date).</p>
<p>For more recent cases, market studies that became investigations are shown as one bar (as there is only one CMA case page). For older cases, the initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Fair_Trading">Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”)</a> review and subsequent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission">Competition Commission (“CC”)</a> investigation appear as separate bars (because there are separate case pages on the CMA’s website). <strong>The annotations can be clicked to go to each case page</strong>.</p>
<p>The bars are coloured by the market sector being investigated (e.g. financial services). Some studies/investigations overlap market sectors (e.g. the online platforms and digital advertising market study falls under ‘communications’ and ‘recreation and leisure’). Each unique combination is given a different colour. The sectors are listed below:</p>
