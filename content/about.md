I am currently working in NERA Economic Consulting's [Antitrust and Competition Practice](https://www.nera.com/practice-areas/antitrust-and-competition.html) in London. I have worked on a variety of interesting competition cases across a range of industries and jurisdictions (see my [CV](https://jamesthomas.uk/cv/) for more detail).

This site is mainly a place for me to keep track of various bits I have worked on and may want to look back on at some point (or share with others when potentially helpful). But if you've somehow ended up here and are feeling nosy you're welcome to poke around (it's mostly technical stuff though)!  

I also maintain a more extensive CV than what I have up on LinkedIn.
