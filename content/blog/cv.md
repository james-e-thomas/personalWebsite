## Experience
### NERA Economic Consulting, Research Officer, Oct 2019-Present *(1 year, 5 months)*

Currently working in NERA's Antitrust and Competition Practice in London. 
Experience includes working on a variety of market investigation, merger, 
cartel, state aid and abuse of dominance cases across a range of industries 
and jurisdictions.

### Office for National Statistics, Summer Intern, Jun-Aug 2018 *(3 months)*

Worked in the Prices Platform Development and Support team of the Economic Statistics Change and Support division. Helped to prepare historical CPI and
RPI data to be inputted into the new CORD system for the Prices division.

Also produced a report with two others on the variation in response/drop-off 
rates by demographic for the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) pilot and presented findings to senior management. Entailed data-work with large datasets 
in SPSS.

## Education

### MSc Economics, University College London, *Distinction*, 2018-2019  

Alongside the core Economics modules, took a number of optional topics in Microeconomics and Competition Economics. See grades attained in table below.

Also wrote a 10,000-word dissertation entitled *Analysing Risky Decisions from 
the TV Game Show "Deal or No Deal"*. This examined the predictions of the standard (expected utility) and 'behavioural' (prospect theory) economic models of a 2008 American Economic Review paper by Thierry Post, Martijn J. van den Assem, Guido Baltussen and 2017 Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler. It finds that both models underestimate contestants' propensity to opt for the safe option of *Deal*-ing (i.e. accepting a certain - but lower - payout) when faced with only one 'large' prize remaining on the board. It is hypothesised that this may be related to the suggestion of Friedman et al. (2014) that standard economic models perform poorly because they fail to capture the layman's perception of risk as the threat of harm. A much simpler (logit) regression model (which makes Deal/No Deal predictions simply based on the two largest prizes remaining) is presented, with mixed results.

### BA History and Economics, Oxford University, *2:i*, 2015-2018

five out of eight Final Degree examinations being in Economics.

Completed a compulsory History dissertation, attaining a grade of 75. The 
dissertation was nominated as the University of Oxford's entry for the *History

### A-levels, British School of Brussels, 2013-2015

<br>

Subject | Level | Grade
--------|------|------
Mathematics | A-level | A\*
Further Mathematics | A-level | A\*
History | A-level | A
French | AS-level | A
Physics | AS-level | A

Having grown up in Brussels, my French is fluent and this exam was not taken alongside the others but rather in 2012.

### IGCSEs, British School of Brussels, 2011-2013

9 A\*s, 2 As and 1 B.  

I took two French exams. One was for French as a native language (taken in 2013, grade A) and the other was the standard French as a foreign language exam (taken in 2011, grade A\*).

## Skills

### Languages: English, French, Italian

Being half-English, half-Italian and having grown up in Brussels, I am fluent in **English**, **French** and **Italian**.

### Software: Excel, Stata, R, Python 

I am proficient in **Excel**, **Stata** and **R**. Though Excel is good for simple modelling and presentation of data and Stata is good for data analyses on a single dataset, I am always interested in developing my capabilities in R and other more powerful programmes. In exploring the capabilities of other programmes I have for example come across the R `blogdown` package, which I have used to create this website (without any need for knowledge of HTML - the standard language used for constructing web pages). 

My capabilities in **Python** at the moment are not as developed as in the other programmes, though I hope to devote time on developing this skill further.
